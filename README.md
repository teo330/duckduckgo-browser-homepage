# duckduckgo-browser-homepage
A customized homepage for DuckDuckGo SE with personal links.
Made to let my mom use the DuckDuckgo SE (instead of Google SE) with Google Chrome, yet keeping a custom list of the 10 most visted sites in the search engine homepage.
Feel free to fork it and use it, just make sure to change the links and images of the shortcuts to whatever you desire.
